A simple app to make a cell phone access through IP addresses to listen for other phones by android(Zane.)

I'm a new Android coder. This project is used to make one phone to listener for other phone which connection on its WiFi hotspot.

One phone can get the information like if network is available and battery remaining capacity by browser in your phone. You are supposed to access the phone by its IP address add port. Like this: 192.168.41.1:8080.

This project have used three library.butterkinef, jdom, nanohttpd.

I just used the jdom to build XML file in the phone,but I think it will be more accessible to build HTML file.Because it will make it more helpful to display data in website.Maybe I will use the renderSnake library.

I used nanohttpd to make mobile terminal to be a web servers.

So, this is just a new project and there is a lot of room for improvement.
